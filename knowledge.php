            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Fixed income products forms the base of a financial plan. If the base is not strong whatever we build upon it is under risk of collapse, therefore by allocating a higher quanta of funds towards fixed income products improves the overall stability of a portfolio.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Company Fixed Deposits</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Fixed Deposits in companies that earn a fixed rate of return over a period of time are called Company Fixed Deposits. Financial insstitutions and Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) also accept such deposits. Deposits thus mobilised are governed by the Companies Act under Section 58A. These deposits are unsecured, i.e., if the company defaults, the investor cannot sell the documents to recover his capital, thus making them a risky investment option.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Benefits of investing in Company Fixed Deposits</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li style="list-style-type:disc;">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>High interest.</span></p>
                </li>
                <li style="list-style-type:disc;">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Short-term deposits.</span></p>
                </li>
                <li style="list-style-type:disc;">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Lock-in period is only 6 months.</span></p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>No Income Tax is deducted at source if the interest income is up to Rs 5,000 in one financial year</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Investment can be spread in more than one company, so that interest from one company does not exceed Rs. 5,000</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Like most investment option, Company Fixed Deposits are a mixed bag. Company FDs can be an interesting investment option if you know how to select the right FD, and how to avoid the no-so-good ones. Here are some of the points that investors should keep in mind.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spread your Risk</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The deposits should be spread over a large number of companies engaged in different industries. This way, you&rsquo;ll be able to diversify your risk among various industries/companies. Try not to put more than 10% of your total investments in one particular company.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Choose the Right Period of Deposit</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Ideally, the investment should be for 1 to 3 years depending upon the rate of interest.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Periodic Review</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The performance of the companies should be reviewed at maturity. This will help you decide whether to renew or reshuffle the deposit. It is also wise to keep a track of these companies by checking their share prices, annual reports and other details reported in newspapers.</span></p>

            <h4><u><span id="5" style="font-weight: bold;">IPO, NFO, NCD GUIDANCE</span></u></h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>An initial public offering, or IPO, is the first sale of stock by a company to the public. A company can raise money by issuing either debt or equity. If the company has never issued equity to the public, it&apos;s known as an IPO.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Companies fall into two broad categories: private and public. A privately held company has fewer shareholders and its owners don&apos;t have to disclose much information about the company. Anybody can go out and incorporate a company: just put in some money, file the right legal documents and follow the reporting rules of your jurisdiction. Most small businesses are privately held. But large companies can be private too. Did you know that IKEA, Domino&apos;s Pizza and Hallmark Cards are all privately held?</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>It usually isn&apos;t possible to buy shares in a private company. You can approach the owners about investing, but they&apos;re not obligated to sell you anything. Public companies, on the other hand, have sold at least a portion of themselves to the public and trade on a stock exchange. This is why doing an IPO is also referred to as &quot;going public.&quot;</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Public companies have thousands of shareholders and are subject to strict rules and regulations. They must have a board of directors and they must report financial information every quarter. In the United States, public companies report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In other countries, public companies are overseen by governing bodies similar to the SEC. From an investor&apos;s standpoint, the most exciting thing about a public company is that the stock is traded in the open market, like any other commodity.</span></p>

            <h4><u><span id="7" style="font-weight: bold;">FINANCIAL PLANNING</span></u></h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>It is the process of meeting your financial goals through the proper management of your finances. Financial goals can include buying a home, savings for your child&rsquo;s education, planning for your retirement or estate planning.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>We help you to work out on where you are now, what you may need in the future and what you must do to reach your goal by the process that involves gathering relevant financial information, setting financial goals, examining your current financial status and coming up with a strategy for a plan on how you can meet with your goals, and map the gap.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Benefits Of Financial Planning:</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Financial planning provides direction and meaning to financial decisions. It allows the client to understand how each financial decision they make affects other areas of their finances.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>For eg. Buying a particular investment product might help them pay off their mortgage faster or it might delay the retirement significantly. By viewing each financial decision as part of the whole, the client can consider its short and long term effects on their life goals. The client can also adopt more easily to life changes and feel more secure that their goals are on track.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">You Pay For It Because:</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>You want to engage the services of a qualified professional and ensure quality advice.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>You save money when you avoid making wrong investment decisions</span><span>.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Financial plan precedes any advice on products and to that extent, is completely unbiased.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>You put your trust in the hands of an expert and your mind at ease.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Our Process</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Our approach to financial planning is simple and straightforward. However, it is also important that you fully understand our consultative process and our step by step approach.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Evaluate Current Position</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>This is the first stage of our interaction. It involves evaluating your current situation which includes cash flow analysis, calculating your net worth, reviewing your insurance coverage for life, disability, home, auto, health etc.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Identify Goals</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>We then go about clearly establishing the objectives of the financial plan so that, several goals can be balanced. The goals could be short, medium or long-term and could include child&rsquo;s education, marriage, your retirement etc.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Work Out the Plan</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>We then work out a clear strategy in line with your objectives and risk tolerance. Drawing up a winning asset allocation so that your financial goals are met is fundamental to a successful plan.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Implement the Plan</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>We will assist you in the process of implementing the plan by suggesting the optimal mix of products and services that are essential for the success of the plan.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Report Periodically</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Once the plan is implemented we will monitor the progress on an on-going basis. We will periodically report the progress and measure the results achieved vis-&agrave;-vis the plan.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Review &amp; Rebalance</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Financial planning is a dynamic process. We will annually review the plan and progress made, to see if any modifications are required due to changes like inheritance, change in job status, birth or death in the family etc.</span></p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why should an NRI invest in India?</span></p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Well developed banking system</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Vibrant capital market. (National Stock Exchange: third largest, Bombay Stock Exchange: 5th largest in terms of number of trades)</span></p>

            <ul>
                <li style="list-style-type:none;">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>a. Long-term capital gains are tax-free</span></p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>RBI notification is silent on the issue of bonus shares and right entitlements. In the case of bonus shares, one can safely take the view that if the bonus shares are allotted as a result of shares for which payment is made by the way of inward remittance in foreign currency or by debit to NRE / FCNR account they would be treated as foreign Exchange Assets. &nbsp;Though nothing specific has been mentioned regarding the right entitlement, one can apply the analogy of bonus shares to right entitlements also.

            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Investing in a mutual fund is like an investment made by a collective. An individual as a single investor is likely to have lesser amount of money at disposal than say, a group of friends put together. Now, let&apos;s assume that this group of individuals is a novice in investing and so the group turns over the pooled funds to an expert to make their money work for them. This is what a professional Asset Management Company does for mutual funds. The AMC invests the investors&apos; money on their behalf into various assets towards a common investment objective.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mutual Fund is a vehicle that enables a collective group of individuals to:</span></p>
            <ol>
                <li style="list-style-type:decimal;">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Pool their investible surplus funds and collectively invest in instruments / assets for a common investment objective.</span></p>

            </ol>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why Financial planning is important?</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Financial planning is one of the most important aspect of ones life which is sadly ignored by the most of the people. It is a must for meeting ones financial goals and securing their future. There are events which are certain to occur in every individuals life and all those events involve heavy financial expense once they occur. E.g i)when one gets married. ii)Birth of a child. iii)Child&apos;s Higher education. iv) Child&apos;s marriage.v) Post Retirement expenses when earnings shrinks. Sometimes sudden medical expenses that might arise during our lifetime etc . Besides he or she needs to beat inflation to maintain his/her living standards. If we park our savings in instruments like saving accounts then infact value of our savings are getting eroded with time .Reason being our historical inflation rate lies between5 to 9 percent, current saving rate is around 4 percent. It means that if we keep Rs. 100 in a saving account for one year then after one year it will amount to 104 but due to inflation the commodity we could have purchased for Rs.100 a year back will cost around Rs.109 .It means our Rs.100 value has eroded in one year. To minimize future financial risks and to achieve financial security mutual funds are one of the best instruments for financial growth.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Savings Vs Investment</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Saving involves income that is not consumed. Savings are low risk funds that must be liquid (available) when you need them. The purpose of saving money is so you can have it for a specific purpose within a short time frame. Investments, on the other hand, are for wealth building, and will not be needed for many years. Yes, investments do involve greater risk, but, investments also yield much greater returns when left alone long enough to ride out the turbulence of the stock market.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why One should invest in mutual funds?</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Saving involves income that is not consumed. Savings are low risk funds that must be liquid (available) when you need them. The purpose of saving money is so you can have it for a specific purpose within a short time frame. Investments, on the other hand, are for wealth building, and will not be needed for many years. Yes, investments do involve greater risk, but, investments also yield much greater returns when left alone long enough to ride out the turbulence of the stock market.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reason 1:</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>They are investments instruments which are capable of giving high returns . An average mutual fund scheme returns easily beats inflation in longer run and a good scheme can give far superior returns</span><span>.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reason 2:</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Our Mutual Fund industry is one of the best regulated industry in the world. They are governed by the strict guidelines layed down by SEBI(Securities &amp; Exchange Board of India).&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reason 3:</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Investments decision of a Mutual Fund is taken by their AMCs and Fund Managers. They are experts who make investments decisions after doing intensive research and analysis of a company &amp; industry. (Individuals generally don&apos;t have time and resources to do research hence best option is to let MF manage your investments)&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reason 4:</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>This industry is highly liquid. Even more liquid than stock markets. Payments are generally made through cheques or in some cases they are directly credited to your bank accounts , If your bank is allowing RTGS &amp; electronic clearing and mutual fund AMC is providing such facility.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reason 5:</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Investments are diversified into many companies &amp; sectors. Which make our investments safer and consistent growth prospects. Diversifying is usually not done by small investors , for such a actions one requires lots of funds.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reason 6 :</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Tax treatments- Governments encourage investments in capital markets and has given many tax sops. Under i) 80(c) investments done upto one lakh in specific mutual funds schemes which is called ELSS(Equity Linked Saving Schemes.) are exempt from tax. ii) Any units held for more than one year if redeemed is treated under long term capital gain tax which is zero percent currently i.e. the whole profit is tax free. If one plans to redeem before one year then he has to pay tax of only15% on the profits.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reason 7:</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Mutual Funds are much cheaper compared to direct exposure to capital market since one does not need demat account ,annual charge to maintain account, charges imposed on demat holdings, stamp duty on transaction are not levied</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Now, let&apos;s assume that this group of individuals is a novice in investing and so the group turns over the pooled funds to an expert to make their money work for them. This is what a professional Asset Management Company does for mutual funds. The AMC invests the investors&apos; money on their behalf into various assets towards a common investment objective.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Hence, technically speaking, a mutual fund is an investment vehicle which pools investors&apos; money and invests the same for and on behalf of investors, into stocks, bonds, money market instruments and other assets. The money is received by the AMC with a promise that it will be invested in a particular manner by a professional manager (commonly known as fund managers).</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The fund managers are expected to honour this promise. The SEBI and the Board of Trustees ensure that this actually happens.&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Open ended funds</span></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>These funds are available for subscription throughout the year. These funds do not have a fixed maturity. Investors have the flexibility to buy or sell any part of their investment at any time, at the prevailing price (Net Asset Value - NAV) at that time.</span></p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>These funds begin with a fixed corpus and operate for a fixed duration. These funds are open for subscription only during a specified period. When the period terminates, investors can redeem their units at the prevailing NAV.</span></p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Equity funds</span></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>These funds invest in shares. These funds may invest money in growth stocks, momentum stocks, value stocks or income stocks depending on the investment objective of the fund.</span></p>
                </li>
                <li style="list-style-type:decimal;">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Debt funds</span></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>These funds invest money in bonds and money market instruments. These funds may invest into long-term and/or short-term maturity bonds.</span></p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hybrid funds or Income funds</span></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>These funds invest in a mix of both equity and debt. In order to retain their equity status for tax purposes, they generally invest at least 65% of their assets in equities and roughly 35% in debt instruments, failing which they will be classified as debt oriented schemes and be taxed accordingly. Monthly Income Plans (MIPs) fall within the category of hybrid funds. MIPs invest up to 25% into equities and the balance into debt</span><span>.</span></p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>These funds invest in physical assets such as gold, platinum, silver, oil, commodities and real estate. Gold Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) fall within the category of real asset funds.</span></p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Diversified Equity Funds</span></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>These funds diversify the equity component of their Asset Under Management (AUM), across various sectors. Such funds avoid taking sectoral bets i.e. investing more of their assets towards a particular sector such as oil &amp; gas, construction, metals etc. Thus, they use the diversification strategy to reduce their overall portfolio risk.</span></p>
                </li>
                <li style="list-style-type:decimal;">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sector Funds</span></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>These funds are expected to invest predominantly in a specific sector. For instance, a banking fund will invest only in banking stocks. Generally, such funds invest 65% of their total assets in a respective sector.</span></p>
                </li>
                <li style="list-style-type:decimal;">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Index Funds</span></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>These funds seek to have a position which replicates the index, say BSE Sensex or NSE Nifty. They maintain an investment portfolio that replicates the composition of the chosen index, thus following a passive style of investing.</span></p>
                </li>
                <li style="list-style-type:decimal;">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)</span></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>These funds are open-ended funds which are traded on the exchange (BSE / NSE). These funds are benchmarked against the stock exchange index. For example, funds traded on the NSE are benchmarked against the Nifty. The Benchmark Nifty BeES is an example of an ETF which links to the stocks in the Nifty. Unlike an index fund where the units are traded at the day&apos;s NAV, in ETFs (since they are traded on the exchange) the price keeps on changing during the trading hours of the exchange. If you as an investor want to buy or sell ETF units, you can do so by placing orders with your broker, who will in-turn offer a two-way real time quote at all times. The AMC does not offer sale and re-purchase for the units. Today, ETFs are available for pre-specified indices. We also have Gold ETFs. Silver ETFs are not yet available.</span></p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fund of Funds (FOF)</span></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>These funds invest their money in other funds of the same mutual fund house or other mutual fund houses. They are not allowed to invest in any other FOF and they are not entitled to invest their assets other than in mutual fund schemes/funds, except to such an extent where the fund requires liquidity to meet its redemption requirements, as disclosed in the offer document of the FOF scheme.</span></p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixed Maturity Plan (FMP)</span></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>These funds are basically income/debt schemes like Bonds, Debentures and Money market instruments. They give a fixed return over a period of time. FMPs are similar to close ended schemes which are open only for a fixed period of time during the initial offer. However, unlike closed ended schemes where your money is locked for a particular period, FMPs give you an option to exit. Remember though, that this is subject to an exit load as per the funds regulations. FMPs, if listed on the exchange, provide you with an opportunity to liquidate by selling your units at the prevailing price on the exchange. FMPs are launched in the form of series, having different maturity profiles. The maturity period varies from 3 months to one year</span><span>.</span></p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Country or Region Funds</span></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>These funds invest in securities (equity and/or debt) of a specific country or region with an underlying belief that the chosen country or region is expected to deliver superior performance, which in turn will be favourable for the securities of that country. The returns on country fund are affected not only by the performance of the market where they are invested, but also by changes in the currency exchange rates.</span></p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>So we have seen that funds can be categorised based on tenor, investment philosophy, asset class, or geographic region. Now, let&apos;s get down to simplifying some jargon with the help of a few definitions, before getting into understanding the nitty-gritty of investing in mutual funds.</span></p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Net Asset Value (NAV)</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>NAV is the sum total of all the assets of the mutual fund (at market price) less the liabilities (fund manager fees, audit fees, registration fees among others); divide this by the number of units and you get the NAV per unit of the mutual fund.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Standard Deviation (SD)</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>SD is the measure of risk taken by, or volatility borne by, the mutual fund. Mathematically speaking, SD tells us how much the values have deviated from the mean (average) of the values. SD measures by how much the investor could diverge from the average return either upwards or downwards. It highlights the element of risk associated with the fund.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sharpe Ratio (SR)</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>SR is a measure developed to calculate risk-adjusted returns. It measures how much return you can expect over and above a certain risk-free rate (for example, the bank deposit rate), for every unit of risk (i.e. Standard Deviation) of the scheme. Statistically, the Sharpe Ratio is the difference between the annualised return (Ri) and the risk-free return (Rf) divided by the Standard Deviation (SD) during the specified period. Sharpe Ratio = (Ri-Rf)/SD. Higher the magnitude of the Sharpe Ratio, higher is the performance rating of the scheme.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">54EC CAPITAL GAIN BONDS</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The benefit under section 54EC can be availed of only if there is an income from a capital asset, being long-term in nature. Long-term capital gains are the profit that a person makes when he sells any capital asset (for example, any immovable property, jewellery or shares) which he has held for a period exceeding three years. An exception is his holding of shares in which the holding period has been fixed at one year.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Any person (including NRI out of NRO account on a non-repatriable basis) and Hindu undivided family (HUF), through its Karta, can make investments (not exceeding Rs 50 lakh in a given financial year) in the two bonds notified by the Government of India. In case only part investment is made, the amount of deduction gets reduced in proportion to the investment.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The two corporations which have been notified by the Government of India as being eligible for issue of these bonds are (a) National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and (b) Rural Electrification Corporation (REC).</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>These bonds carry a lower rate of interest as compared to other investment options, such as Public Provident Fund, bank fixed deposits and National Savings Certificates, among others. The main reason for this lower rate of interest is that the investor gets the benefit of reducing his income tax liability upon investing in these bonds, if he has long-term capital gains. These bonds are issued for a fixed maturity period of three years. These bonds have been rated as &ldquo;AAA/Stable&rdquo; by Credit Rating and Information Services of India (CRISIL).</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The investment has to be made within six months from the date of the transfer in order to be eligible for claiming the benefit of deduction under section 54EC. The face value of these bonds is Rs 10,000, and the full amount has to be paid upfront along with the application.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The maximum amount that a person can invest in these bonds (NHAI and REC combined) in any financial year is Rs 50 lakh. If a person has long-term capital gains which have accrued to him after 1 October of any year, and the amount of capital gains exceed Rs 50 lakh, he can split his investment by investing Rs 50 lakh up to 31 March of the following year and the balance on 1 April of that year. The balance amount in this case, however, should not exceed Rs 50 lakh. By doing this, he can have the benefit of investment of up to Rs 1 crore. Joint applications shall also be included for the purposes of this limit.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The deemed date of allotment is the last date of the month in which the application is made and the amount is realised by the issuer.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>These bonds can be held in dematerialised form or in physical form. The bonds can be held under a single name or joint names. The facility for nomination is also available on these bonds. These bonds are non-transferable, non-negotiable and cannot be offered as security for any loan or advance. However, transmission of the bonds to legal heirs in case of death of the bondholder is allowed under the rules.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The NHAI bonds carry interest at 6.25 per cent per annum, payable annually on 31 March every year. REC bonds carry interest at 5.75 per cent per annum, payable annually on 30 June every year. The interest earned on these bonds is fully taxable under the head &ldquo;Income from Other Sources&rdquo;. No tax at source would be deducted from the interest on these bonds.</span></p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>New Section Introduced in Income Tax Act 2011: Section 80CCF was introduced in the Income Tax Act, 1961 in the budget of February 2010. As per this section investments made in notified infrastructure bonds are exempt from tax up to maximum of Rs 20,000 per year. Section 80CCF allows individuals to invest Rs. 20,000 in infrastructure bonds, and reduce this amount from taxable income. This exemption is in addition to the Rs. 100,000 deduction under section 80C (Investment in instruments like ELSS Mutual Funds, Life Insurance, Provident Fund etc).&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Interest Income is Taxable: The interest income from infrastructure bond is taxable. The interest will be added to investors taxable income. This means even though the investment in these bonds is exempt from tax (maximum Rs 20,000). interest income is not. This means investment under section 80CCF is advisable only after the investor has completely exhausted Rs One Lakh investment under section 80C.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The funds raised through these bonds will be utilised towards &quot;infrastructure lending&quot; as defined by the RBI in the regulations issued by it from time to time, after meeting the expenditures of, and related to the issue. These infrastructure bond issues are part of the government&apos;s effort to mobilise money to part-fund the massive $1-trillion infrastructure spend it has planned for the Twelfth Plan.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Tax Benefits: Under section 80CCF of the Income Tax Act, Rs 20,000 per annum paid or deposited as subscription to long term infrastructure bonds shall be deducted in computing the taxable income. This is over and above Rs 1,00,000 tax benefit available under section 80C, 80CCC and 80CCD.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Pros: The limit of Rs 20,000 per annum is in addition to Sections 80C, 80CCC and 80CCD. Hence, it is advisable to consider applying in this issue. Cons: The bonds are locked in for five years, so there is no exit in case you need the money midway which restricts liquidity.</span></p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>A type of debt instrument that is not secured by physical asset or collateral. Debentures are backed only by the general creditworthiness and reputation of the issuer. Both corporations and governments frequently issue this type of bond in order to secure capital. Like other types of bonds, debentures are documented in an indenture.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Debentures have no collateral. Bond buyers generally purchase debentures based on the belief that the bond issuer is unlikely to default on the repayment. An example of a government debenture would be any government-issued Treasury bond (T-bond) or Treasury bill (T-bill). T-bonds and T-bills are generally considered risk free because governments, at worst, can print off more money or raise taxes to pay these type of debts</span></p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Term life insurance is the purest form of life insurance It provides insurance protection for a specific period of time, such as 10, 15, 20 or 30 years. If the insured person dies within the time the policy is in force, the nominees/beneficiaries receive the Sum assured amount of the policy tax-free. If you outlive your policy term, the insurance terminates and you must buy another policy if you still want to carry life insurance. You can also buy term life insurance that covers you until you reach a certain age, usually 65 or 70.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Since it is a &quot;pure life insurance protection,&quot; term life insurance is also the cheapest form of life insurance. Because of its low cost among life insurance types, term life continues to be the product of choice by most of the people seeking protection.&nbsp;</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Generally, any one purchases life insurance to replace him for household income in case of death, so that loved ones can pay debts and living costs, without compromising on the standard of living. For example, if an family buys a home with some loan, and one of the spouse were to die tomorrow, the other spouse would have to pay the mortgage on his or her own. If they had a term life insurance policy, the surviving spouse could receive enough tax free money from the policy&apos;s death benefit to pay off the mortgage.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Term insurance doesn&apos;t just cover specific debts, however. If case of children&rsquo;s education, term insurance is low cost life insurance that can provide money for college and living expenses if the life assured were to die before your children are fully grown.</span></p>

                </li>
                <li style="list-style-type:none;">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The premium remains constant thru the period of the policy, so if a young person opts for such an insurance, the effective inflation makes the premium cheaper every year.</span></p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cons:</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li style="list-style-type:none;">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Affordable.</span></p>
                </li>
                <li style="list-style-type:none;">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>No cash value &ndash; This being a pure insurance, the premium is an expense for the cover utilised.</span></p>
                </li>
                <li style="list-style-type:none;">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>If your term expires, the cost increases exponentially to buy a new policy.</span></p>

                <li style="list-style-type:none;">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Very easy to stop the policy, since there is no &lsquo;loss&rsquo; of income</span></p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Medical exam is usually required</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>When you apply for term life coverage, the insurance company will probably require a medical exam before issuing a policy. The examination covers your height, weight, blood pressure, medical history and blood and urine testing. With the blood and urine tests, the insurer looks for specific medical problems and the presence of nicotine. Positive results could affect your premium, or even your ability to buy a policy.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Smokers will usually pay more for term life insurances.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Different flavours of term life</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>As you age, the likelihood you will die increases. That&apos;s why life insurance costs more as you get older. You can lock in low premiums by buying for a &quot;level premium&quot; policy. That means for a specific time period, say 20 years, your premium rate stays the same. Many term policies give you the option to renew your coverage at the end of the term without undergoing another medical exam, although your premiums will rise for annually after the level term period &mdash; often substantially. A less popular policy is &quot;annual renewable term.&quot; This gives coverage for one year with the option of renewing it each year for a specified duration, such as 20 years. With this policy,the rates go up every year you renew and are calculated based on the probability of life assured&rsquo;s dying within the next year.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>If someone would like to have term life insurance in place to provide for beneficiaries yet he/she is confident that he will outlive the policy period , then he could consider &quot;return of premium&quot; term life insurance. Under this type of policy, if no death benefit has been paid by the end of your insurance term, they will receive all your premiums back. It pays to shop around for a policy like this, but on the low end you can expect to pay 50 percent more in premiums than comparable traditional term life insurance.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">How long a term?</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Figuring out which term you should buy &mdash; 10 years, 20 years, 30 years or some other number &mdash; requires a major review of your debts, financial needs, dependents&apos; needs &mdash; and when all those might change. Typically one should take the maximum possible term, when buying a term insurance, as the probability of getting the claim is highest, the premiums remain constant for the said period and at an older age, due occurrence of life-style deases such as blood pressure or diabetes, the premiums could rise substantially or one may not be insurable too. It&apos;s a good idea to review your life insurance needs carefully &amp; regularly, both when you buy the policy and when there&apos;s major a life change.&quot;One may not have the adequate coverage needed or may have more than you needed&rdquo; either ways is not efficient.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">In short, the objectives for buying term insurance are as under :</span></p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Term life insurance is the purest form of life insurance It provides insurance protection for a specific period of time, such as 10, 15, 20 or 30 years. If the insured person dies within the time the policy is in force, the nominees/beneficiaries receive the Sum assured amount of the policy tax-free. If you outlive your policy term, the insurance terminates and you must buy another policy if you still want to carry life insurance. You can also buy term life insurance that covers you until you reach a certain age, usually 65 or 70.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Since it is a &quot;pure life insurance protection,&quot; term life insurance is also the cheapest form of life insurance. Because of its low cost among life insurance types, term life continues to be the product of choice by most of the people seeking protection.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Generally, any one purchases life insurance to replace him for household income in case of death, so that loved ones can pay debts and living costs, without compromising on the standard of living. For example, if an family buys a home with some loan, and one of the spouse were to die tomorrow, the other spouse would have to pay the mortgage on his or her own. If they had a term life insurance policy, the surviving spouse could receive enough tax free money from the policy&apos;s death benefit to pay off the mortgage.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Term insurance doesn&apos;t just cover specific debts, however. If case of children&rsquo;s education, term insurance is low cost life insurance that can provide money for college and living expenses if the life assured were to die before your children are fully grown.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">These are the offers these pros and cons of term life insurance:</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pros:</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li style="list-style-type:none;">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Affordable.</span></p>
                </li>
                <li style="list-style-type:none;">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Good for someone who has a mortgage or wants coverage for children&rsquo;s education planning or a retirement kitty for surviving spouse.</span></p>
                </li>
                <li style="list-style-type:none;">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Can be used as a a tool to do a charity, as the life assured can nominate a Trust or an NGO as the beneficiary in case of death.</span></p>
                </li>
                <li style="list-style-type:none;">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The premium remains constant thru the period of the policy, so if a young person opts for such an insurance, the effective inflation makes the premium cheaper every year.</span></p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cons:</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li style="list-style-type:none;">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>No cash value &ndash; This being a pure insurance, the premium is an expense for the cover utilised.</span></p>
                </li>
                <li style="list-style-type:none;">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Very easy to stop the policy, since there is no &lsquo;loss&rsquo; of income</span></p>
                </li>
                <li style="list-style-type:none;">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>If your term expires, the cost increases exponentially to buy a new policy.</span></p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Medical exam is usually required</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>When you apply for term life coverage, the insurance company will probably require a medical exam before issuing a policy. The examination covers your height, weight, blood pressure, medical history and blood and urine testing. With the blood and urine tests, the insurer looks for specific medical problems and the presence of nicotine. Positive results could affect your premium, or even your ability to buy a policy.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Smokers will usually pay more for term life insurances.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Different flavours of term life</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>As you age, the likelihood you will die increases. That&apos;s why life insurance costs more as you get older. You can lock in low premiums by buying for a &quot;level premium&quot; policy. That means for a specific time period, say 20 years, your premium rate stays the same. Many term policies give you the option to renew your coverage at the end of the term without undergoing another medical exam, although your premiums will rise for annually after the level term period &mdash; often substantially. A less popular policy is &quot;annual renewable term.&quot; This gives coverage for one year with the option of renewing it each year for a specified duration, such as 20 years. With this policy,the rates go up every year you renew and are calculated based on the probability of life assured&rsquo;s dying within the next year.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>If someone would like to have term life insurance in place to provide for beneficiaries yet he/she is confident that he will outlive the policy period , then he could consider &quot;return of premium&quot; term life insurance. Under this type of policy, if no death benefit has been paid by the end of your insurance term, they will receive all your premiums back. It pays to shop around for a policy like this, but on the low end you can expect to pay 50 percent more in premiums than comparable traditional term life insurance.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">How long a term?</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Figuring out which term you should buy &mdash; 10 years, 20 years, 30 years or some other number &mdash; requires a major review of your debts, financial needs, dependent&apos;s needs &mdash; and when all those might change. Typically one should take the maximum possible term, when buying a term insurance, as the probability of getting the claim is highest, the premiums remain constant for the said period and at an older age, due occurrence of life-style deases such as blood pressure or diabetes, the premiums could rise substantially or one may not be insurable too. It&apos;s a good idea to review your life insurance needs carefully &amp; regularly, both when you buy the policy and when there&apos;s major a life change.&quot; One may not have the adequate coverage needed or may have more than you needed&rdquo; either ways is not efficient.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>In short, the objectives for buying term insurance are as under :</span></p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is General Insurance?</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Insurance other than &apos;Life Insurance&apos; falls under the category of General Insurance. General Insurance comprises of insurance of property against fire, burglary etc, personal insurance such as Accident and Health Insurance, and liability insurance which covers legal liabilities. There are also other covers such as Errors and Omissions insurance for professionals, credit insurance etc. &nbsp;Non-life insurance companies have products that cover property against Fire and allied perils, flood storm and inundation, earthquake and so on. There are products that cover property against burglary, theft etc. The non-life companies also offer policies covering machinery against breakdown,there are policies that cover the hull of ships and so on. A Marine Cargo policy covers goods in transit including by sea, air and road. Further, insurance of motor vehicles against damages and theft forms a major chunk of non-life insurance business. &nbsp;In respect of insurance of property, it is important that the cover is taken for the actual value of the property to avoid being imposed a penalty should there be a claim. Where a property is undervalued for the purposes of insurance, the insured will have to bear a rateable proportion of the loss. For instance if the value of a property is Rs.100 and it is insured for Rs.50/-, in the event of a loss to the extent of say Rs.50/-, the maximum claim amount payable would be Rs.25/- ( 50% of the loss being borne by the insured for underinsuring the property by 50% ). This concept is quite often not understood by most insureds. &nbsp;Personal insurance covers include policies for Accident, Health etc. Products offering Personal Accident cover are benefit policies. Health insurance covers offered by non-life insurers are mainly hospitalization covers either on reimbursement or cashless basis. The cashless service is offered through Third Party Administrators who have arrangements with various service providers, i.e., hospitals. The Third Party Administrators also provide service for reimbursement claims. Sometimes the insurers themselves process reimbursement claims.</span></p>
